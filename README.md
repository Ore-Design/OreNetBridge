## Overview

The **OreNetBridge** is a public repository that contains necessary classes for integration with Ore Design's NetSuite implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the OreNetBridge, follow these steps:

1. **Add Repository to your Project:**
   Maven Central is used to host the public repository. Make sure that you have the repository source listed in your package manager.

   Gradle:
   ```bash
   repositories {
      mavenCentral()
   }
   ```
   Maven:
   Maven already includes mavenCentral.

   Then add the API to your project dependancies.

   Gradle:
   ```bash
   dependencies
   {
      implementation 'design.ore.api:OreNetBridge:1.0.0'
   }
   ```
   Maven:
   ```bash
   <dependency>
	<groupId>design.ore.api</groupId>
	<artifactId>OreNetBridge</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```
